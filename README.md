> Transform robots.txt files into security reconnaissance goldmines - automated harvesting and analysis at scale.

## Overview
The robots.txt file, while designed to guide web crawlers, often inadvertently discloses sensitive path information. These paths can include administrative panels, hidden API endpoints, development environments, and other non-public resources. robotsDisallowed is a solution engineered to systematically collect, parse, and analyze these files, transforming publicly available data into actionable security intelligence.

This tool provides a significant advantage in security assessments by automating the discovery of potential attack surfaces that are frequently overlooked by standard scanning tools.

## Core Capabilities

- Data Aggregation: The system gathers robots.txt files from extensive sources, including the lists of top-tier domains, bug-bounty domains, and user-provided URLs.

- Intelligent Analysis: Collected files are processed to extract, normalize, and de-duplicate disallowed paths. The engine uses pattern recognition to categorize findings and identify potentially high-value targets.

- Wordlist Generation: It produces context-aware wordlists tailored for security assessments. Outputs are filtered based on sensitivity and can be exported in multiple formats (e.g., TXT, JSON, CSV) for seamless integration with other tools.

## Applications
- Offensive Security: For penetration testers and bug bounty hunters, it accelerates the reconnaissance phase by identifying unique endpoints and hidden directories, leading to more effective vulnerability discovery.

- Defensive Security: For organizations, it serves as a crucial tool for security audits, helping to identify exposed internal assets, support compliance requirements, and continuously monitor the organization's digital footprint for unintended disclosures.

## Roadmap
Future development is focused on integrating machine learning for predictive path analysis and introducing technology stack-specific heuristics for more targeted discovery.

## Ethical Use Disclaimer
robotsDisallowed is intended for authorized security research and professional engagements only. Users are solely responsible for ensuring they have explicit permission to scan any target. All activities must comply with responsible disclosure principles, legal regulations, and applicable usage policies.
